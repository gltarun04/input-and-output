1)The environmental eco club has discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given, write a  program to displays the amoeba’s size……???. For Example, The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.
Input format:
The first input containing an integer which denotes the number of the month
Output format:
Print the amoeba size.
Refer the sample output for formatting.
Sample Input:
7
Sample Output:
8
...
n=int(input())
a=0
b=1
for i in range (3,n+1):
	c=a+b
	a=b
	b=c
print (c)

2)Write a program to determine whether 'n' is a factorial number or not. Factorial of a number is the product of all positive numbers from 1 to 'n'.
Input format:
The input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number.
Output format:
If the given number is factorial, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".

Sample Input:
6
Sample Output:
Yes

3) a = 0, b=0, c=1 are the 1st three terms. All other terms in the Lucas sequence are generated by the sum of their 3 most recent predecessors. Write a program to generate the first n terms of a Lucas Sequence.
Input format:
The input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number
Output format:
Print the  'n' terms of the Lucas Sequence, separated by a single space. There are no leading or trailing spaces in the output.
Refer the sample output for formatting.
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
0 0 1 1 2
...
n=int(input())
a=0
b=0
c=1
print(a,end=’ ‘)
print(b,end=’ ‘)
print(c,end=’ ‘)
for i in range (4,n+1):
	d=a+b+c
	a=b
	b=c
	c=d
	print(d,end=’ ‘)

4)The rules for generating Collatz Sequence are:
If n is even:   n = n / 2
If n is odd:    n = 3n + 1
For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is:
5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
It has been proved for almost all integers, the repeated application of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends at 1.
Input format:
The input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number
Output format:
Print the numbers in the sequence and also print the number of times the rule has to be applied in order to reach 1.

5)Write a program to check whether the given number is a trendy number or not. A number is said to be a trendy number if and only if it has 3 digits and the middle digit is divisible by 3.
Input format:
The input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number
Output format:
If the given number is a trendy number, then print "Trendy Number". Otherwise, print "Not a Trendy Number".
Refer the sample output for formatting.
Sample Input:
791
Sample Output:
Trendy Number

...
n=int(input())
if(n>=100 and n<=999):
    a=n//10
    b=a%10
    if(b%3==0):
        print("Trendy Number")
    else:
        print("Not a Trendy number")
else:
    print("Not a Trendy Number")
